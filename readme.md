## Practical guidelines about state

- Use a state variable for data **that will change at some point**
- Want something in the component to be **dynamic**
  Example: A modal window can be open or closed
- Want to change the way a component looks, or the data it displays, **update its state**.
- For data that should not trigger component re-renders.**don't use state**.
